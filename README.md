Comparing bars to a range using tricolor palette and interactive annotations
Comparing bars to a range using tricolor palette and interactive annotations


Using matplotlib to apply interactive annotations to the base visualization in order to understand uncertain data better


This project is a part of my work done for the Coursera Data Science specialization by University of Michigan. We were asked to recreate the visual presented in the paper Ferreira et al, 2014.

I implemented the bar coloring where the color of the bar is actually based on the amount of data covered. I added the interactivity button that allows user to interactively set a range of y values they are interested in, and recolor based on this

      
Note: The data given for this assignment is not the same as the data used in the article and as a result the visualizations may look a little different.
